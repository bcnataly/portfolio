# Human Resources Data Analysis – MySQL and Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

The Techniserv Group, a U.S. technology company, commissioned a human resources data analysis focusing on its employees. The project aimed to provide valuable insights into the demographics, distribution, and compensation of the workforce and create a visual report to communicate this information to senior HR management and other stakeholders.
The project utilized MySQL for data preparation, exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, and Power BI for executive-level visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL Workbench** – Data exploration, cleaning, and transformation.  
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - Aggregation, Conditional, Mathematical, String, and Date functions
  - Clauses for Data Grouping and Ordering
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design and executive-level visualization:
- **GitHub** – Version control and public repository hosting.

## 🧭 Project Workflow

The **script.sql** file contains the process of data preparation and exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

### 🔍 Data Preparation and Exploration
- Create the database.
- Import the table from a .csv file (employees.csv).
- Review the number of rows and columns.
- Check data types.
- Display the first few rows of the table.
- Understand the information contained in each column of the dataset:
  
| Column Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `id_employee`       | Unique identifier for each employee |
| `first_name`        | Employee's first name |
| `last_name`         | Employee's last name |
| `gender`            | Employee's gender (`hombre`, `mujer`) |
| `birth_date`        | Employee's date of birth |
| `departmento`       | Department where the employee works (`Accounting`, `Engineering`, `Human Resources`, `Marketing`, `Sales`, `Services`, `Support`) |
| `monthly_salary_usd`| Employee's monthly salary in USD |
| `work_modality`     | Work modality (`0`, `1`, `2`) |
| `country`           | Country where the employee works |

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
-	Identify missing values.
-	Remove duplicate rows.
-	Correct typographical errors in a column.
-	Modify data types across multiple columns.
-	Standardize categorical levels to English.
-	Replace the integer values with categorical values.
-	Adjust the number format to a numerical column and the date format to a date column.
-	Drop irrelevant columns.

### 🔄 Data Transformation
-	Create a column to calculate the age of each employee.
-	Create a column to calculate annual salary in USD.
-	Assign appropriate data types to the new columns.
-	Remove columns that are not needed for the analysis.

### 📈 Analysis
The dataset was analyzed using SQL queries to extract insights. 
-	Total number of employees.
-	Average annual salary per employee.
-	Average employee age.
-	Distribution by department, gender, and work modality.
- Highest-paid employees.
-	Average annual salary by gender.

### 💾 Save Cleaned Data
The final cleaned table is saved in the **clean_employees.csv** file and used as the data source for visualization in Power BI.

### 📊 Data Visualization
The dashboard uses visual elements to present key insights about the Techniserv Group workforce. Data visualization is available in both the **dashboard.pbix** Power BI file and the **dashboard.pdf** file.
